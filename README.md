# CS-465 Full Stack Development with MEAN
# Travlr App

This application consists of an Express website that displays trip packages that are stored in the MongoDB database. The database was designed to store user information, and trip packages. A Passport.js local strategy is used to authenticate users. The admin back end for the application is built with Angular as a single-page application from which admin users can add, edit, and delete trips to the database and consequently the Express website. To tie all of this together, we use a Node server to respond to API requests.
 
Most of this application was developed in the CS-465 Full Stack Development I course at SNHU. To enhance this application and to demonstrate my skills, I continued to fill out the functionality of the application.
